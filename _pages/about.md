About me
=====
I am a PhD candidate working with [[Xucong Zhang]](https://www.ccmitss.com/zhang) at the [[Computer Vision Lab]](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/intelligent-systems/pattern-recognition-bioinformatics/computer-vision-lab/) of Delft University of Technology. I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from Delft University of Technology in the summer of 2023. My research is centered around deep learning techniques for understanding human behavior, and their potential applications in fields such as human-robot interaction and healthcare.
